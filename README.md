# ContractsGeneration-WP
WordPress plugin that generates PDF contracts and sends them by email to the customers when certain products are bought.

Subsequently, the customer has to preview the contract, sign it and upload it using a frontend dashboard. The owner receives the contract, signs it and uploads it back using a backend dashboard (wordpress plugin page) to be sent back to the customer.
The contract is filled with customer data dynamically.
